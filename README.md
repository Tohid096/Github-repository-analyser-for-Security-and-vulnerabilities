## ✨ Features
- **🔍 Dependency Scanning:** Automatically detects vulnerable dependencies by cross-referencing with the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and CVE records.
- **🔑 Secret Detection:** Identifies exposed API keys, tokens, passwords, and credentials using pattern matching and entropy analysis.
- **📊 Code Quality Analysis:** Evaluates code for security anti-patterns, insecure coding practices, and potential vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
- **📝 Best Practices Check:** Verifies compliance with security best practices and industry standards including OWASP Top 10.
- **📈 Risk Visualization:** Interactive dashboards display security findings with severity ratings and risk scores for better prioritization.
- **📄 Comprehensive Reports:** Generates detailed reports with actionable remediation steps and verification procedures for each finding.

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- NPM (v6.0.0 or higher)
- Git
- GitHub API token (for authentication)

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-security-analyzer.git
cd github-security-analyzer
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```env
GITHUB_API_TOKEN=your_github_api_token
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Step 4: Start the application
```bash
npm start
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🚀 Usage

### Analyzing a Repository
1. Navigate to the GitHub Repository Security Analyzer web application.
2. Enter a valid GitHub repository URL in the input field (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repository`).
3. Select the analysis options you'd like to perform:
   - Dependency Scanning
   - Secret Detection
   - Code Quality Analysis
   - Security Best Practices
4. Click the "Analyze Repository" button to start the analysis process.
5. Wait for the analysis to complete. The time required depends on the repository size.
6. Review the security analysis results on the dashboard.

### Example
```javascript
// Using the API programmatically
const axios = require('axios');

async function analyzeRepository() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:3000/api/analyze', {
      repoUrl: 'https://github.com/example/project',
      options: {
        dependencyScanning: true,
        secretDetection: true,
        codeQuality: true,
        bestPractices: true
      }
    });
    
    console.log('Analysis results:', response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Analysis failed:', error.message);
  }
}

analyzeRepository();
```

## 🔒 Security Analysis

The GitHub Repository Security Analyzer performs multi-layered security analysis:

### Dependency Vulnerability Scanning
- Parses dependency files (package.json, requirements.txt, Gemfile, etc.)
- Cross-references dependencies with vulnerability databases (NVD, CVE)
- Calculates CVSS scores for risk assessment
- Identifies outdated packages with security patches available

### Secret and Credential Detection
- Scans for API keys, tokens, passwords, and private keys
- Uses pattern matching and entropy analysis
- Checks commit history for previously exposed secrets
- Minimizes false positives with machine learning algorithms

### Code Quality Analysis
- Identifies security anti-patterns in code
- Detects potential injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, CSRF)
- Evaluates input validation and output encoding practices
- Checks for deprecated or insecure function usage

### Security Best Practices Assessment
- Verifies security configuration files and headers
- Evaluates authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Assesses secure communication protocols
- Checks for security-oriented CI/CD practices

> ⚠️ **Note:** The analyzer requires public repository access or appropriate permissions for private repositories.

## 📊 Reports

The security analyzer generates comprehensive reports with the following sections:

### Executive Summary
High-level overview of the security posture, including:
- Overall risk score and rating
- Number of findings by severity
- Comparison to industry benchmarks
- Key recommendations for improvement

### Detailed Findings
For each security issue detected, the report includes:
- **Vulnerability Details:** Name, identifier, severity, affected component
- **Attack Vector:** Exploitation methods and prerequisites
- **Impact Assessment:** Potential consequences and affected systems
- **Remediation Instructions:** Step-by-step guidance to fix the issue
- **Verification Steps:** How to confirm the vulnerability is fixed

### Export Formats
Reports can be exported in multiple formats:
- PDF (detailed report with visualizations)
- CSV (tabular data for further analysis)
- JSON (machine-readable format for integration)
- HTML (interactive web report)

### Report Sample
**Vulnerability Summary**
| Severity | Count | Risk Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![Critical](https://img.shields.io/badge/Critical-red) | 2 | 9.8 |
| ![High](https://img.shields.io/badge/High-orange) | 4 | 7.5 |
| ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-blue) | 7 | 5.2 |
| ![Low](https://img.shields.io/badge/Low-green) | 12 | 3.1 |
